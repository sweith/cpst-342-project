    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We were “matched” on the dating app Bumble on July 26, 2016 and our first date was a picnic in Lincoln Park on August 6. <br>
        On August 5, 2018, Steve re-created our first date in Lincoln Park to get down on one knee and propose. <br>
        We were married July 20, 2019 and we spent our honeymoon in Italy from October 23 to November 2, 2019.
